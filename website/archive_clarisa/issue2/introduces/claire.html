           <i>Hey you! <br><br>
            It’s me again. <br><br>
            I am writing to you again; even though you are never going to read my letters.<br>
            I want to talk to you about things you do not know,<br>
            I haven’t managed to forget about you, and now we no longer talk, whoever you are still<br>
            alive in my mind and in my heart.<br>
            I think of you sometimes; enveloped in the emptiness of my unfulfilled desires.<br>
            Living in the prison of my own mind, where all I see is regret, for you not being around<br>
            anymore. <br><br>
            But I want to break free.<br>
            I want to free myself from the spell you casted upon me.<br>
            I guess I am having a hard time accepting that you are gone. But it is hard, I just never got to<br>
            tell you how much I actually admired you and how I looked up to you. <br><br>
            I just want to be able to say goodbye.<br>
            We are strangers now and it has been so long, but I haven’t forgotten about you.<br>
            I see hope when hope is not there, I think of you when you are not there. I write to you even<br>
            though you are not listening. <br><br>
            I am sorry. <br><br>
            I have no power to change the past and I have no power in changing the present either.<br>
            All I can do is write you a goodbye letter that you are never going to read, sit here, cry about<br>
            it and wish I never met you.</i>

            <span>What excites you about this piece of work that you're showing?</span><br><br>
                My work "The Vase" was created in the spirit of the LARp x Hectobar 9.1 online collaboration. To me the value of this work lies in its arbitrary and transformative character. By showing "The Vase" at Clarisa, in a completely different light and manner than it was initially shown, I was hoping to inspire its new owners to continue the work, if they would like to do so.

            <span>Are you currently developing or working on something new?</span><br><br>
            I am currently working on a big cross-disciplinary project. 
            In this project visual artists, musicians, filmmakers and collectives come together to experiment, play and co-create new work under the theme of Visualising Music. With our project we want to explore music beyond its traditional audible form and allow it to crystallise across a variety of media including video, installation, photography, painting and performance art.<br> <br>
            The fruits of our collective efforts will manifest in an exhibition and a public event program which will take place in Amsterdam in October 2021!
