                        I work with different mediums that resonate together: paintings, drawings, sculptures and photography. The collecting gesture allows me to constitute archives of locations, shapes, forms and contexts that I will use. <br><br>

                        All the layers of work and mediums leading to something else, need I suppose, to become one in one same other medium, like a book or a lecture. I feel that this is where they function the best, that the use of multiple mediums make sense when they gather in this other medium.<br><br>
                        
                        About ‘style’ I don’t know, something that reoccurs is the integration of usually ‘poorly done’ or ‘child like’ hand-written text with images. This text can have multiple functions: it can caption an image, give it a title, but also provoke a shift, a loss or add sense to the image. Also, there is an indirect link with graffiti in my relationship to landscape, as an attitude of appropriation and invading of scenery.<br><br>
                        
                        Finally, all these researches that I explained above, this whole (hi)story generates shapes, that are like many possible images, often poor or depreciated, that I can appropriate.

                        Buffalo Grill is a restaurant chain located along the roadsides in France, actually at the periphery of cities and towns. It’s a leader restaurant group in France and its generic outlooks are inspired by a fantasised American ranch. It is a journey to Disney-world for the price of steak and French fries which explains its popularity. I initiated a sort of self-assignment of capturing all of them with a camera but gave up quickly, now I try to collect all the goodies and derived products from the chain, but also testimonies given by employees about the working conditions there, which sound quite execrable…

                        I try to mix references from my surrounding culture, a culture that is specific to the French suburban landscape, involving architectural elements or the reception of media images. A landscape without real singularity, ‘new’ towns without stories or ‘history’.  
                        <br><br>
                        Coming from Normandy, the main event that modified this landscape is the allied landing on the coast in 1944. It is almost like the starting point of the local history, a ‘Nativity’. An event that has been heavily promoted in Hollywood productions, like ‘Saving Private Ryan’ or ‘The Longest Day’.  The United States, themselves also bombarded cities - sometimes completely - they delivered houses in kit form to rehome bombarded civilians in 1945. Those kit houses ‘the UK 100’ contained all the modern comfort, American style. Those houses are a forgotten heritage falling into ruin. In a more global history, those houses are yet peculiar to this neutral territory: for example they were implemented in Tennessee to accommodate engineers working on the conception of atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima or Nagasaki…
                        <br><br>
                        I research about those moments of local history, of personal stories, in line with the Great History. I am interested in potential fictions given by these American vestige in Normandy and how to pull the strings of the (hi)stories to re-enchant those crisis zones.  Also, the memorial tourism of the Second World War became a real business in the area. I grew up surrounded by American and British flags, with people dressing up like soldiers on weekends… This modifies completely our relationship with the real and I try to play with these elements. 
                        <br><br>
                        So I circumnavigate around the theme of war but also on the war consequences on the cultural and material landscape. I am interested because it was here. Since I am a working class child, if I had grown up in another suburban zone of the area, I would have pulled the strings of history in another way.

                        </span> <br><br>
                        I consider this project like a large story taking as the starting point the announced destruction of the last UK 100 house of the city of Caen. I followed and built a relationship with the inhabitant of this house. This book redraws the story of these houses but also Franck and his family’s story through photography, archive documents and drawings.<br>

                        <br>At the same time I got interested in the ordinary stories of my grand-parents. My grandmother was working in an automotive parts factory and my grandfather was an amateur painter since he retired from his job in a hardware store. He was a direct witness of the bombardement destroying his city in 1944. So the city was completely rebuilt and he was only painting the pre-war buildings, the everlasting countryside scenes. Those stories are full of digression of the quarter where I grew up. I also mix personal middle school anecdotes with the history of urbanism, local beliefs, like with these dolmens I crossed. This book had a multitude of layers, of depth, small stories intertwining with the bigger history. This work allows me also to approach people, to give them a voice, to let them create shapes.<br>
                        
                        <br>Two years after the first volume, I realize that almost all the shapes or persons that I mention have disappeared, or have been destroyed. The last UK 100 has been demolished, my grandfather passed away, the HLM housing that I visited were blown up, the social context is more and more tense. There is a sort of urgency to deal with the subjects that I capture, to try to resist to their disintegration by putting them in fictions. This urgency is maybe the reason why I juggle with different mediums.

                        </span> <br><br>
                        I am currently artist/researcher with the doctorate program RADIAN. For my research I’m doing the genealogy of the UK 100 houses, which has never really been done in the past. I want to see how they foreshadowed the process of peri-urbanisation, and that there is a direct connection between those stories. I want to understand the aesthetic - social and economical issues; how an artist can make use of fiction to subvert, reconsider, reappropriate those territories from “here” coming from “elsewhere”. At a time of impoverishment of a part of the inhabitants and a lack of representation (seen with the yellow jackets for example) I think it is important to tell the stories of those places. 
                        <br><br>
                        In parallel I am also working on a movie which will take place between Normandy and Tennessee, a fictive documentary which will redraw let’s say all this suburbian american-normandy history.
